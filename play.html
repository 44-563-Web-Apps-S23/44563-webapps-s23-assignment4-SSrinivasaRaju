                <h5>COMEDIAN. </h5>
                <p class="direction">[_Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the
boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors._] </p>
<p class="speech">That way</p>
<p class="direction">[_pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction_]</p>
<p class="speech">is thirty miles. This way</p>
 <p class="direction">[_pointing to left_]</p> 
<p class="speech">is forty-five--and that way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never
reach to-day. The nearest way for us is back to where we came from,
whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
crowned our histrionic successes.</p>

><h5>VILLAIN.</h5>
 <p class="direction">[_Exhausted._]</p> 
 <p class="speech">Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth.</p>

<h5>COMEDIAN.</h5> 
<p class="speech">and on your head, then, and let your perspiration water a more fruitful soil.</p>

<h5>VILLAIN.</h5> Oh!

     <p class="direction">[_He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. He then sinks down onto
     one of them and wipes off the perspiration, moving his hand wearily
     over his face. The_ TRAGEDIAN _and the_ "OLD MAN" _approach the
     post and read the signs_.</p>

<h5>TRAGEDIAN.</h5> 
<p class="direction">[_In a deep, dramatic voice._] </p>
<p class="speech">It's hopeless! It's hopeless!</p>
<p class="direction">[_He lets go his end of the trunk._</p>

<h5>"OLD MAN."</h5> 
<p class="direction">[_Lets go his end of the trunk._]</p> 
Mm. Another stop.

<p class="direction">[TRAGEDIAN _sits himself down on the trunk in a tragico-heroic
     pose, knees wide apart, right elbow on right knee, left hand on
     left leg, head slightly bent toward the right_. COMEDIAN _puts down
     the valises and rolls a cigarette_. The "OLD MAN" _also sits down
     upon the trunk, head sunk upon his breast_.</p>

<h5>VILLAIN.</h5> 
<p class="speech">Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles!</p>
